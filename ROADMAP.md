# MeshFlow Roadmap

This is the public roadmap. It is a living document — priorities shift based on community feedback and market signals. The most important source for roadmap input is [GitHub Discussions → Roadmap](https://github.com/Anteneh-T-Tessema/meshflow/discussions/categories/roadmap).

- ✅ MeshFlow Cloud GA — ModelRouter analytics, cost regression CI gate, cross-session memory analytics
- [ ] MeshFlow Sessions — annual developer event
- ✅ Analyst briefing kit in docs/analyst_briefing/
- [ ] Fundraising process (if required)
- [ ] deepset (Haystack) co-marketing partnership
- ✅ Confidence threshold early exit (`stop_on_confidence` on Team and Crew)
- ✅ Parallel context dedup across crew agents

## Not planned

Items we have deliberately chosen not to build:

- **A visual-first, no-code-primary product.** MeshFlow is code-first. The visual builder is an addition, not the foundation.
- **Hosted model serving.** We are framework infrastructure, not a model provider.
- **A fork of LangGraph or CrewAI.** We wrap them. We don't replace them.

If you disagree with any of these decisions, the right place to argue the case is [GitHub Discussions → RFCs](https://github.com/Anteneh-T-Tessema/meshflow/discussions/categories/rfcs).

## How to influence the roadmap

1. **Vote on existing discussions.** Thumbs-up on the issues and RFCs that matter most to you.
2. **File a compliance gap.** If a regulatory requirement isn't covered, it goes to the top of the queue.
3. **Submit an RFC.** Major new features need an RFC before implementation begins.
4. **Tell us your production scenario.** The most persuasive argument for prioritization is "this is blocking us from shipping to production."

The roadmap is driven by one question: **what does it take for a Fortune 500 engineering team to trust MeshFlow with their production agent workloads?**
